feat: Enhance portfolio with new features and improvements

This commit introduces a series of enhancements and refactorings across the portfolio:

- **Skills Section:**
  - Implemented a minimal design with interactive tooltips on hover, showing skill name and progress.
  - Replaced framer-motion based tooltip with a basic CSS-only solution.
- **Projects Section:**
  - Implemented a dynamic bento grid layout with responsive column and row spans.
  - Added hover effects including scale, glowing border, and dimming of non-hovered items.
  - Moved project data to `src/data/projects.json` for better organization.
  - Updated image links to use `picsum.photos` with unique seeds.
  - Ensured mobile responsiveness with a 1-column (xs), 2-column (sm), and 4-column (md+) grid.
- **Resume Section:**
  - Enhanced interactivity with `ScrollReveal` animations for content and download button.
  - Added a placeholder image for resume preview.
  - Made the download button "more alive" with hover effects (scale, shadow) and a pulsing animation.
- **Global Improvements:**
  - Organized CSS files into `src/styles` and updated all import paths.
  - Implemented a dark/light mode toggle with theme persistence using `localStorage`.
  - Configured Tailwind CSS for dark mode (`darkMode: 'class'`).
  - Added smooth transition (200ms linear) for theme changes.
  - Adjusted top padding in all sections (except Hero) to prevent content overlap with the fixed Navbar.
  - Fixed `MouseSmokeEffect` to allow clicks to pass through and cover the entire project area.
