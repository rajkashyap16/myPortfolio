fix: Conditionally set base path in vite.config.js for Netlify deployment

This commit modifies `vite.config.js` to conditionally set the `base` path.
- If `process.env.NETLIFY` is true (during Netlify builds), `base` is set to `/`.
- Otherwise (local development or GitHub Pages builds), `base` remains `/myPortfolio`.

This resolves the blank page issue when deploying to Netlify, as Netlify expects a root base path unless configured otherwise.
